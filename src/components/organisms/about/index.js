I actively seek out opportunities to learn new and relevent skills and challenge myself.

    I have experience in Flash game development, web development using LAMP stack, WordPress development with custom plugins and themes.  most recently I've bee worked as an instructor / mentor for a few years as I studied, practiced and taught more modern technologies. 

    Now I specialize in modern JavaScript, React and serverless architechture with AWS. I am experienced with the ecosystem of technologies that have evolved around modern SPAs, and am now looking to do what I do best and what I love: Developing custom, innovative user applications!

    <Content title = "My experience:">
    I started programming as a Flash game developer. After developing a few games, I became interested in web development and shifted my focus to HTML5 and JavaScript. I developed a couple LAMP stack web applications, then WordPress with custom plugins and themes. Meanwhile, I also worked as an instructor / mentor for a few years as I studied, practiced and taught more modern technologies.
