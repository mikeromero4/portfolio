<h3>of Michael Romero</h3>

Most of my work is closed source, so this is the best sample of a front-end project that i can show

In this project:
<ul>
<li>Attention has been put towards organizing a good file structure that is both scalable and modular. scss files follow BEM methodology and are grouped with coresponding components.</li>

<li>The design is fully responsive and the HTML is well structured and semantic.</li>

<li>Components are modular and reusable</li>


<li>Normally i would try to design with better support for older browsers, but considering the target audience, I skipped writing some fallbacks and support for older and uncommon browsers.</li>
</ul>
3rd party code other than gatsby:
  sticky header
  anchor scroll
