<h2>portfolio website</h2>
<h3>of Michael Romero</h3>

Most of my work is closed source, so this is the best sample I can show of my coding style and ability.

In this project:
<ul>
<li>Attention has been put towards organizing a good file structure with modular and reusable components.</li>
<li>CSS follows BEM methodology, precompiled with scss and grouped with respective components.</li>
<li>Responsive mobile-first design and accessable semantic markup.</li>

<li>JavaScript follows functional practices and uses modern ES6+ syntax</li>

<li>Normally i would try to design with better support for older browsers, but I'm preamptively assuming (predicting) that 99% of the target audience for this site will be using modern browsers, I skipped writing some fallbacks and support for older and uncommon browsers.</li>
</ul>
3rd party code other than gatsby:
  sticky header
  anchor scroll
